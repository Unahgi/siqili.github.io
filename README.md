## Objective
The website is part of my portolio using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. My introduction, experience I had, and the required SVG arts will be included in the website.
## Instructions
By clicking the button "View My Visualizations", you can see the SVG arts. By clicking "Back to Home", you'll return to the home page and see my portfolio content.
To go through all the information on the website, you can either scroll down the home page or click on the tab "About", "Experience", and "Contact".
