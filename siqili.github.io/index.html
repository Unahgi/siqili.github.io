            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>I am a Vancouver-based cinematographer and photographer passionate about turning everyday moments into cinematic experiences. With a background in Interactive Arts and Technology at SFU, I specialize in filming, media arts, and post-production. I use Adobe Premiere, After Effects, Lightroom, and Photoshop to bring stories to life. Whether behind the camera or in the editing room, my goal is always the same: to create resonant visuals. </p>

            </ul>
                <p>The primary challenge stemmed from location constraints, as the cabin secured via Airbnb proved to be spatially limiting for wide-angled indoor shots. To address this, I crafted a shot list and a shooting schedule stripboard tailored to emphasize close-up shots, incorporating diverse camera angles and movements to maintain visual intrigue while working within the cabin's confines. This deliberate approach aimed to avoid visual fatigue and enhance the intensity of the narrative. </p>
                <p>With a mere 30-hour window allocated for cabin shooting, prioritization became important. Recognizing the centrality of cabin scenes to the storyline, I made strategic decisions to fully maximize our time within this space. However, acknowledging the script's forest-based sequences, I strategically scheduled additional shoot days in a separate forest location to capture these atmospheric outdoor scenes.</p>

                <li><strong>Warped</strong> - Short Film</li>
                <p>The journey began with a collaborative brainstorming session to shape our video game content. I contributed individual perspectives, leading to the creation of a comprehensive mood board. This board served as a visual compass, summarizing color schemes, artistic styles, and visual elements. It proved invaluable, providing clarity and serving as a guiding light, especially when faced with art direction challenges during post-production.</p>
                <p>Once the visual style crystallized, I delved into crafting the shot list. The video comprised two distinct worlds: reality and the immersive gaming realm. For the reality scenes, a choice was made for traditional, static camera angles. Conversely, to emulate the gaming world, the focus shifted to one-take long shots, elevating the sense of continuous immersion. The incorporation of dynamic camera movements—like dolly and tracking shots—aimed to mirror the authentic gaming experience.</p>
